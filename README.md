# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project and resulting web page are the results of the prework assignment for the upcoming coding bootcamp I have enrolled in.

- My motivation for this project was to be as prepared as possible for the bootcamp by completing all the prework and learning from it. 
- This project was built in stages in which I learned many basic building blocks and methods used in development.
- What problem does it solve? It provides a web based "study guide" Which I can access from any connected device and share with others if needed.
- During this project I learned a little bit about HTML, CSS, markdown, git and github, version control, javascript, and other things.
